# Predicting-the-Success-of-a-Google-Play-Store-App-

In this project, my partner and I analyze and try to predict the success of a Google Play Store app using R.

Dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

Methods used, conclusion, and code can be found in the pdf. Both the linear and tree model codes can be found in the separate python file as well. You will need to download the data set from Kaggle first, import and name it "googleplaystore" before being able to run the code.
